All sorts of idiotic mistakes, but essentially:
1. Created my own repo and pushed these changes using my ribo916 user (my windows pc). The actual repo is owned by vbrich, but gave permissions to ribo916. Don't ask. 

The code here is for [This Video Tutorial](https://youtu.be/uNd9HxIHptY)

The purpose of this code/tutorial is to teach how to use Cypress to create E2E tests for your apps

Switch over to the `tutorial` branch if you'd like to use this repo without the finished Cypress tests or if you want to follow along with the tutorial.
